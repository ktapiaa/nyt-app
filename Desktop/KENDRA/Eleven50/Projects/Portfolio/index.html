        You better get your coat out, this is going to be a cold painting. Let's just drop a little Evergreen right here. This is a happy place, little squirrels live here and play. We might as well make some Almighty mountains today as well, what the heck. This is your world, whatever makes you happy you can put in it. Go crazy. These things happen automatically. All you have to do is just let them happen.

        Clouds are free they come and go as they please. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. If these lines aren't straight, your water's going to run right out of your painting and get your floor wet. Put it in, leave it alone. What the devil. Nice little fluffy clouds laying around in the sky being lazy. We don't want to set these clouds on fire. And maybe a little bush lives there.

        You can't have light without dark. You can't know happiness unless you've known sorrow. A little happy sunlight shining through there. The more we do this - the more it will do good things to our heart. We'll put a happy little sky in here. Just think about these things in your mind and drop em' on canvas. Now then, let's play. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in it. Let that brush dance around there and play. I sincerely wish for you every possible joy life could bring. Think about a cloud. Just float around and be there.
